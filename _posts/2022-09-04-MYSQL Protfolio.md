### Introduction 
I am very familiar with the open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), MySQL. The master's in data science course I took included a full course dealing with MySQL. In addition, I have completed a few MYSQL courses on Coursera and Linkdin. Moreover, I used MySQL to query the customers' bills and call details from the switching server while I worked for the Bangladesh Telecommunication (BTCL) Company in Bangladesh.  

## The Key skills and knowledge applied :

- Designed the database architecture
- Designing Data Flow Diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams, and Data Structure Diagrams.
- Performed database development and implementation activities.
- Responsible for configuring, tuning, and maintaining MySQL Server database servers.
- Implemented the necessary procedures and packages for extracting, transforming, and loading data.
-  Enabled views, stored procedures, and queries in the database
