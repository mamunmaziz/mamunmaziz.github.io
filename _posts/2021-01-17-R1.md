As part of my Post Graduate University program of Data Science, I had to accomplished few data science projects using R programming.  Among those, one was   conducted with the data of Queensland’s Road Crash from year 2001 to year 2018. 
The purpose of the project was to 
(1) find the changes of total crash per year by different severity and found any relation between them. 
(2) achieve the change of pattern of crashes along the year. 
(3) compare the pattern of changes of road crashes for the decade 2001 to 2010 and same for year 2011 to 2018. 

The datasets were downloaded from http://data.qld.gov.au http://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/f3e0ca94-2d7b-44ee-abef-d6b06e9b0729 (Transport and Main Road, 2019).
Those ‘Crash data from Queensland Roads’ was originally collected by Department of Transport and Main Road (TMR) and the authority collected it by observational study from recorded police reports. The crashes in this dataset are based on two basic criteria -(a)crashed occurred on public road and (b)at least a person was killed or injured.

**It is to be noted that as, after the 31 December, 2010 the Queensland Police Service terminated the criteria – ‘Property damage only crashes’, the data before that day also account the crashes that damaged property other than vehicles at an amount of $2500 or more.**

Following 3 dataset were used in the analysis:
|Data file                      | Total Observations | Total Variables |
| :---                          |  :---:  |  ---: |
| locations.csv                 |328247   | 53    |
| factorsinroadcrashes.csv      | 3277    | 13    |
| driverdemographics.csv        | 14198   | 16    |
