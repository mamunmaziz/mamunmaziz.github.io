## Overview
My Power Bi portfolio includes some of my analysis and dashboard work completed during my master's degree in data science and several online courses to demonstrate my competence in Power BI reports and dashboards. For security and compliance reasons, some of this portfolio's data and details have been altered.

### The Key skills and knowledge applied :  
- Utilize power query to perform ETL.
- Access Data from cloud, csv, excel, SQL.
- Data transform and Preparation (update and append table).
- Create custom tables, relationships, star, or snowflakes schema Tables.
- Prepare data Visualization and reporting 
- DAX measure calculation using sum, count, calculate, divide, and time intelligence.
- Create Dynamic Measure, Dynamic Dimension, Tooltip, Bookmark in reporting. 
- Add alerts and subscriptions to the dashboard
- Publish dashboards, workspaces, and apps and collaborate with others.

## Financial Report
This project involved the implementation of many more Power Bi techniques by using the data preparation tool, transforming data, customizing tables, conditional formatting, merging queries, pivoting and unpivoting, one-to-one and many-to-many relationships, filter visuals, filter pane, TopN filter, Sync Slicers, Treemap Visuals, drill through, keep filter with drill through, custom column, conditional column, Maps, drill through with a button, bookmarks, cards, working with tooltip pages, working with parameters, calculating columns and measures in DAX language and so on.
Using the above techniques, I have used data from a few products used in different parts of the United States.
Revenue and sales are displayed on the first page by product. Additionally, it contains revenue and sales by order date.
The second page shows sales and revenue by state and subcategory. On the third page, sales by weekday are also shown, with a filter to find specific revenue by order date.
 On the fourth page, the Total Amounts of Revenue are displayed using a multi-row card. Bookmarks and cards are used to show the details of specific top 3 products. The 5th page shows the entire cost of logistics services and the total cost for the year. To show the details when hovering over the state bar on page 2, a tooltip was created.
