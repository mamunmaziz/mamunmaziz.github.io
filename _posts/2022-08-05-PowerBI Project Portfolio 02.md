## Sales Report
The top page adds a home page by using a bookmark and button that allows us to navigate all other pages of the report. This study examined five products and their sales all over the world over a specific period of time.

On the first page, there is a sales report containing total and gross sales across countries with slicers for Product, year, and month. To make the report attractive, a scroll bar shows total sales per country along with a search visual for drilling down into the country. The Profit and Discount page shows profit and discounts across the country and time, and the product is also used as a slicer.


The sales by month page displays sales of products by month with bar charts for each selected product. The sales by product page uses an area chart to show all the sales for all products, and the detail page includes all the details. Here, matrix tables contain the detailed amounts by product, and card visuals show totals such as sales and gross sales. Reports use drilling through and DAX Dynamic measures to calculate average sales and average gross sales per country.

## Budget spending Analysis
On the first page, a company's budget is presented along with its total annual and quarterly expenditures. The second page of the report contains quarterly budgets by business unit and department, as well as the sum of quarterly budgets and spending, which is ultimately the annual budget and spending. Data drilling by quarter is done using drill through. DAX Dynamic Measure is used to calculate annual spending and budget. On the third page, the top ten items are listed according to budget and expenditure per annum. A table and bar are also used to show the annual budget, spent, and remaining table and bar.

## Agro Market Analysis in Bangladesh 
The dataset used in this analysis represents a variety of agro products in Bangladesh. For ease of access, a home page was created using bookmarks that linked to each visualization page.  A page with the motion technique was created with the 'Play Axis' visual theme to show the Geo Graphical visual of monthly feed sales and the page was given the name 'Geo-Graphical Visual'. In the video, regions, years, months, sales, and category-based map locations are shown with bubbles indicating the size of sales quantities in MT for each region, year, and month.

On the first three pages, the market size is shown as a regional map where sales volume is used to determine the size of bubbles. Some pages make use of filters for groups, categories, and regions, as well as buttons. The tooltips are arranged according to drilling through and hovering over.
 
On the fourth page, the table shows the market structure and shares of different companies. Page five and page six contain sales data, region-wise production data, market size information, and growth data for fish products. On the seventh page, fish production statistics are presented in an elaborate table by region. Eighth page shows top performers by area and category. The rank group is used here to filter by category. On page nine, market shares for different feed products are presented in tabular form. Basically, the last page shows the achievement percentage of non-performers by territory and month.
